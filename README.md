Starter template for Manat√≠ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) projects.

## Requirements

Make sure that the latest version of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is installed in your computer.

## Creating a new project

To bootstrap a new project, run the following command:

```bash
yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/ManatiCR/manati-nextjs-base
```

This command will ask you for a project name, create the corresponding folder,
create the base structure and then run `yarn install` to install all the
dependencies.

## Getting Started with an existing project

* If needed, run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.

* Make a copy of `.env.local.example` with the name `.env.local`. Edit it and
  change the necessary variables to match your local environment.

* Run the development server:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
